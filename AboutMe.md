# Hello, I am Krish Doshi 👋

Thanks for stopping by. Here's a little bit about myself...

👀 I’m interested in Big Data, Data Analysis, and Data Engineering.

🌱 I’m currently learning Apache Airflow.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting data-related projects.

## What I Do

🛠️ I work on Data Engineering Projects, specializing in building robust data pipelines, ETL processes, and data warehousing solutions.

📊 I'm passionate about Data Analysis, where I explore datasets, uncover insights, and make data-driven decisions.

🌐 I'm keen on diving deep into Big Data, dealing with massive datasets, and harnessing the power of distributed computing frameworks.

🌪️ I'm exploring Apache Airflow for orchestrating and automating complex data workflows.

📈 I'm also delving into DBT (Data Build Tool) for transforming data in the analytics stack, enabling seamless data modeling and analytics.

## My Expertise

📈 Data Engineering: I design, develop, and optimize data pipelines, ensuring data is accessible, reliable, and scalable.

📊 Data Analysis: I perform exploratory data analysis, generate visualizations, and derive meaningful insights from data.

📡 Big Data: I'm exploring technologies like Hadoop, Spark, and distributed databases to tackle large-scale data challenges.

⚙️ Apache Airflow: I'm learning to use Apache Airflow for orchestrating complex data workflows, automating tasks, and scheduling jobs.

🔄 DBT (Data Build Tool): I'm honing my skills in DBT to build and manage data transformations for analytics.
